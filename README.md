## Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify animals into their respective classes based on their characteristics. The classification is performed using several supervised learning algorithms, and the performance of these models is compared.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Zoo Dataset**, which contains the following:
- A set of animal features (e.g., hair, feathers, eggs, milk, etc.)
- The class to which each animal belongs.

The data preprocessing steps include:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- Merging additional information about animal species and classes.
- Removing redundant columns with high correlation.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualization and analysis of the dataset to understand feature distributions.
   - Dropping features that are highly correlated and do not contribute meaningfully to classification.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data.
   - Feature engineering, such as combining related tables and handling categorical variables.

## Machine Learning Models
Various supervised learning algorithms were applied, including:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forests**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
5. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**

## Results and Evaluation
- The accuracy of each model was computed and compared to select the best-performing model.
- Visualization of results to highlight the performance of different models.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to animal classification, providing insights into model selection and performance optimization for this dataset.
